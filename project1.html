            <p>K-means clustering is a method for finding clusters and cluster centres in a set of unlabelled data. 
                It is important to segment, in our case customers, to help the marketing team to launch a new product and use different advertising 
                methods for different type of customers. </p>

            <h2>introduction</h2>

            <p> Although we understand the importance of the data, it is crucial to
                properly manage data. It is a first step in effectively analysing data
                which leads to important insights. The volume and speed data is
                generated has grown beyond human comprehension in last decades. Data can contain a
                variety of useful information and studying it collectively can uncover
                very minor patterns and details.</p>
                
                <div class="line-break"></div>
                <h4><p style="font-style: italic;">Things get done only if the data we gather can inform and
                inspire those in a position to make a difference." - Dr. Mike Schmoker.</p></h4>
                <div class="line-break"></div>
                
                <p>With the advancement of a big data, there has been a shift from
                experience-based decision-making to a data-driven decision making in
                upper management in businesses. Although data-driven decision is
                powerful tool, but does not undermine the experience and expertise of
                the leaders. Insights derived from data can help managers to approach
                decision-making process on more reliable and concrete ground. Data
                analytics can aid businesses in improving operations in different levels
                by assessing metrics for effectiveness and process outcomes. It also
                helps to identify financially unviable processes replacing it with more
                enhanced streamlines. Data analytics enable businesses to constantly
                monitor market trends to improve customer service or launch a new
                product that can be positively received by customers. For example,
                retailers can analyse customer purchasing process to better understand
                the demand and their customer's buying habits. Even more, businesses can
                quickly determine advertisements for their target demographic, which is
                the main subject of this project.</p>

                <h2>Data understanding</h2>
                <p>
                    Effective data analysis requires an understanding of the problem we are
                    trying to solve. We need to know the questions we are hoping the get
                    answer. The next step is to identify what information or what variables
                    we need in order to answer those questions. In our case it is customer
                    information with variables as below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>customer_id - unique identification of a customer</li>
                    <li>gender - gender of a customer - 0:Male - 1:Female</li>
                    <li>marital_status - marital status of a customer - 0:Single - 1:Non-single</li>
                    <li>age - age of a customer</li>
                    <li>education - education level of a customer - 0:Unknown/other - 1:High-school - 2:University - 3:Graduate level</li>
                    <li>income - reported annual income of a customer</li>
                    <li>occupation - occupation of a customer - 0:Unemployed/Unskilled workers - 1:Skilled employees - 2:Highly qualified/Management positions</li>
                    <li>settlement_size - size of a city the customer lives in - 0:Small city - 1:Mid-size city - 2:Big city</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Next important step of data analysis process is Exploratory data
                    analysis (EDA). EDA is used to look at the data and think about the data
                    from many points of view. In order to better understand the pairwise
                    relationship between variables we are using pair plot. This creates a
                    visualization summarizing a important part (in our opinion) of our data
                    in single figure.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./assets/images/project1/figure1.png" alt="Pair plot of variables."

                    <center><figcaption>Pair plot of variables.</figcaption></center>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    To better understand the important correlation coefficients we are using
                    correlation matrix. From the heatmap below we see the positive
                    correlation between "age" and "education". Or in other words older
                    people tend to be more educated in our sample. From matrix we can see
                    married people are more educated. And settlement size gets bigger by
                    better job or occupation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the features in our data is "age". "Age is an important
                    determinant of expenditure shares for every budget category. Expenditure
                    shares increase with age for food at home, and to some extent, housing
                    and health, but decrease with age for food away from home, apparel,
                    transportation, and other purchases." To evaluate our customer's
                    demographic we are plotting distribution plot of age. The average age of
                    the customers is 35.9, the median is 33.0 and mode is 26 years old. Or
                    people aged 26 is more frequent in dataset. According to statista.com
                    most active and largest group of social media users in UK are people
                    aged 18-34. It is 54% of our customers. Number of people in age group
                    34-64 is 865 with 43% of customers. From the box plot there are 57
                    customers aged 65 and above which are considered natural outliers. And
                    we will not treat them as we would with artificial ones.

                    Gender plays a huge role in understanding people's purchasing habits.
                    Gasiorowska reported the differences between
                    male and female buying behaviours. According to the study "the male
                    customers' buying behaviour is instrumental in nature and prefer minimal
                    level of engagement and finish the purchasing process fast". On the
                    other hand "females exhibit more impulsive buying behaviour than men,
                    enjoy shopping more than men, and decide to buy products by evaluating
                    various products in different stores rather than buying products from a
                    single store". Keeping it in mind it is paramount to analyse
                    distribution of age by gender of the customers. 1086 of customers are
                    male out of 2000 with 54.3% of the total population. With average age
                    of 38. Female customer's average age is slightly younger than the males
                    with average 34 years old.

                    Data distribution in "income" feature reveals that average income of
                    the customers £120954. Most of the customers has annual income £69487.
                    Fewer people have income starting from £200000. Those data shown as
                    outliers in box plot in Figure 3. Average income distribution between
                    males and females are not pronounced. Average annual income for males is
                    £128K, for females £113K. Only 61 males out of 1086 earning from £200K,
                    it is only 5.6%. This number is even small for females with 18 out of
                    914. It is roughly 2% of females earning £200K and over annually.

                    All age groups are represented in all three occupation types. Number of
                    unskilled workers 633 (32%), skilled employees 1113 (56%) and highly
                    qualified employees or managers 254 (12%) people of our total sample
                    population. We see that income has positive correlation with age. But it
                    is not as significant as with occupation type. More skilled the employee
                    is more they are getting paid. Average income for unskilled workers is
                    £91K, for skilled workers £125K, for highly qualified employees or
                    managers it is £176K annually.

                    contrary, majority of unskilled workers are filled with female workers
                    with 57%. Male and female gender distribution is fairly evenly

                <h2>K-means clustering</h2>
                <p>
                    K-means clustering is a method for ﬁnding clusters and cluster centres
                    in a set of unlabelled data.
                    It is important to segment customers to help the marketing team to
                    launch a new product and use different advertising methods for different
                    type of customer groups. Marketing and sales groups use k-means to
                    better identify customers who have similar behaviours and spending
                    patterns.</p>

                    <p>We will try to find and group customers based on common characteristics
                    such as age, gender, income, residing area, marital status and
                    education. Before feeding our data into K-means model we need apply
                    standardization to treat all the features equally. Standardization is
                    achieved by "StandardScaler()" function of a python sklearn library.
                    It is basically transforms the values of features to the same numerical
                    values. After this process the data can be fed into the model.</p>

                    <p>One of the fundamental steps in unsupervised learning using K-means is
                    to determine "K" value. In order to identify number of clusters or
                    optimal "K" value we are using the "Elbow method". Elbow methods
                    objective is to find the smallest value of "K" that still has a low
                    value of inertia. As seen in the
                    Figure 8, the plot formed an elbow and value 3 or 4 would be optimal
                    cluster formation.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./assets/images/project1/figure10.png" alt="K-value using 'Elbow method'."

                    <center><figcaption>K-value using "Elbow method".</figcaption></center>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Once the K value identified we need to find values for centroid
                    initialization. Centroid initialization can be done manually or
                    randomly. When centroid values found we can create a plot with clusters
                    or groups of customers with similarities. Our first segmentation with
                    "age" and "income" variables shown in Figure 9. The algorithm
                    segregated customers mostly by income value rather than age. In this
                    cluster we used K value 4 and we have 4 groups.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="./assets/images/project1/figure9.png" alt="K-means clustering with 'income' and 'age' attributes."

                    <center><figcaption>K-means clustering with "income" and "age" attributes.</figcaption></center>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    But we cannot use this as a final result as we did not consider all
                    other variables. In order to segment customers by all features we are
                    using "kmeans()" function. K-means algorithm finds the centroids for
                    each cluster we decided to choose from elbow method. K-means find the
                    best centroids by alternating between assigning data points to clusters
                    based on the current centroids and choosing centroids based on the
                    current assignment of data points to clusters.
                    From below table we see three segment or group of customers with average
                    values for each variable:

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        We used several exploratory data analytics techniques and different
                        types of data visualizations such as pair plots, distribution plots, box
                        plots, correlation heatmap and scatter plots. From the results of
                        K-means clustering model we found 3 different demographic and geographic
                        group of customers. Each of these groups consists of customers from
                        different locations, gender and age. First group consists of mostly from
                        married women who lives in small cities. Second group majority is single
                        men in their mid-30s living in big cities and working in skilled
                        positions. Third group is the oldest group with average age of 55.
                        Gender in this group evenly distributed by married women and men. This
                        group also is highly educated group. Considering these each of them can
                        be useful for different type of product advertisements.

                        Customer's occupation plays important role in peoples purchasing habits.
                        According to JingWu:ZhengLin customers have different
                        consumption customs in different industries. Also, Gasiorowska reported that men and women differ in terms of
                        shopping behaviour. Considering these companies should establish
                        different marketing strategies for different targeted groups.
