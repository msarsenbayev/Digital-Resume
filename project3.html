            <p>Google Maps reviews provide direct feedback from customers who have interacted 
                with a business. By scraping and analyzing these reviews, businesses gain valuable insights 
                into what customers appreciate, complain about, and desire. This helps to 
                better understand their strengths and weaknesses from a customer's perspective. </p>
            
                <p>For this project, I scraped Google Maps reviews for a Holiday Inn hotel in 
                Aktau, Kazakhstan. The reviews were then analyzed to identify the most common 
                topics and sentiments expressed by customers. The analysis was performed using 
                Python and its libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The 
                results were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>
                <p>The analysis revealed 
                that the most common topics mentioned in the reviews were the hotel's staff 
                and service, the cleanliness of the rooms, and the quality of the food.
                The sentiment analysis showed that the majority of 
                reviews were positive, with customers expressing satisfaction with the hotel's 
                services and facilities.</p>
                <p>Below shown the plost of most common words from 5-star reviews:</p>

                <p>The insights gained from this analysis can help the 
                    hotel identify areas for improvement and capitalize on its strengths to attract 
                    more customers.</p>
