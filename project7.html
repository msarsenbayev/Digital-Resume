                One day local business owner contacted me to help with their excel spreadsheet, saying that 
                they were struggling to get a daily and monthly summary data.
                The business was designed around production of a "Crushed stone" in a quarry outside of a city.
                They provided me with a excel spreadsheet that looked like in below picture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Basically there was a seperate table in a new sheet for a different day. So, there were 
                30 different sheets and tables for one month only. And there was no way to get summary out of it
                easy way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to contact business owner and clarify some questions I had and learned that
                they own one quarry, two Crushing and Screening Complex, one Excavator, three Dump trucks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Their daily production goal was minimum 500 tonns of 5-20mm aggregates. But they did not know
                how much exactly they are producing in daily average. And they were struggling to calculate if it was 
                viable to rent another Excavator and several Dump trucks to increase their production or 
                at least avoid down time if one of the equipments broken down.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the minimum information in hand I started creating a seperate tables for different
                Crushing and Screening Complexes. The table includes:
                <li>How many tonns of stones every Excavator crushed</li>
                <li>How many tonns of stones each Dump truck delivered</li>
                <li>How many tonns of aggregates each Complex produced by size</li>
                <br>
                So, I have two tables for every Complex that look like in the picture below: 
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\images\project7\DSK1.png" alt="DSK1" width="750">
                <center><figcaption>Table for Crushing and Screening Complex 1</figcaption></center>
            </figure>

            <p>
                And the summary table must have been created to get a total number of aggregates created daily.
                I used a date as a starting point and used -sumif() function to get summary of aggregates two Complexes 
                produced for each day. The summary table looks like in a picture below:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\images\project7\summary.png" alt="summary" width="750">
                <center><figcaption>Summary Table</figcaption></center>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
                This table consists of aggregates from each Complex by day and by size. And from this table
                it will be possible to get a statistical data for every Excavator, every Dump truck and every Complex.
                And we can use PivotTable to do it much faster and easier.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\images\project7\stats.png" alt="stats" width="750">
                <center><figcaption>PivotTable and Pivot Chart for one month</figcaption></center>
            </figure>

            <p>
                From this data it was obvious that business was not achieving their daily goal of 500 tonns 
                of aggregates. In fact the daily average was 262 tonns. Which is almost two times less and mostly 
                was due to frequent Excavator issues. Half of the month the Excavator was out of service. 
                Since they had only one Excavator those days production was zero.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets\images\project7\chart.png" alt="chart" width="750">
                <center><figcaption>Daily production</figcaption></center>
            </figure>

            <p>
                If they had second Excavator and kept production going with the daily average 500 tonns aggregates,
                the company would make 32,500,000.00 monthly. And their loss every month due to Excavator issues
                was 15,000,000.00. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Excavator rent price was around 2 million a month. It means company could double their monthly revenue
                just renting extra Excavator. 
            </p>
